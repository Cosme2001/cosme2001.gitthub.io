Welcome to my portfolio! This project serves as a professional introduction to me. It leads to my Linkedin and my GitHub account
showcasing my many projects and future projects. It has an about me section, links to many links that tell more about me. It
also contains a form that allows someone to send me there Name, Phone, Email, and a brief message. I created this site using 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can see the live version of my portfolio at: https://cosme2001.github.io/cosme2001.gitthub.io/
